#Summoner Spell tracker for League of Legends

##Idea
This website let's you track the cooldowns of your opponent's summoner spells.

Start the timer with a tap on the summoner and you'll see when the spell goes off cooldown.

Included features:
* Automatic recognization of "Insight" Mastery (15% CDR of Summoner Spells)
* Distortion boots (manual toggle)

##Legal Note
